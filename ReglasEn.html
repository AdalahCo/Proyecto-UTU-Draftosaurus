    <h1 id="title">Draftosaurus</h1>
   <div id="introduccion">
        <p>Draftosaurus is a family and strategic board game designed by Antoine Bauza, Corentin Lebrat, Ludovic Maublanc and Théo Rivière. It was published in 2019 by Ankama and Board Game Box. It is a quick game (10-15 minutes per game) with draft and worker placement mechanics, in which players build their own dinosaur park with the goal of obtaining the most points.

            <p>Forest of Sameness
You can only place dinosaurs of the same species here. They are placed from left to right, with no gaps. At the end of the game, you score points according to how many dinosaurs are in this enclosure. The more you manage to place, the more points you get.

Meadow of Differences
In this enclosure, each dinosaur must be a different species—no repeats allowed. They are also placed from left to right, without gaps. At the end, you score points based on how many different species you managed to gather here.

Prairie of Love
Any species is allowed. Every pair formed by two dinosaurs of the same species gives you 5 points. You can make multiple pairs, even of the same species.

Woody Trio
You can place up to three dinosaurs here, of any type. If at the end of the game there are exactly three dinosaurs in this enclosure, you score 7 points. If there are fewer than three, you get no points.

King of the Jungle
You can only put one dinosaur here. You score 7 points if, at the end of the game, you have at least as many dinosaurs of that species in your park as the player with the most (which could be you or someone else). If you don’t meet this condition, you get no points.

Solitary Island
This enclosure accepts only one dinosaur. It gives you 7 points only if that dinosaur is the only one of its species in your entire park. If you have another of the same kind anywhere else, you get no points.

River
This isn’t a regular enclosure, but you can place any dinosaur here if you can’t or don’t want to follow the dice restriction, or if it doesn’t fit in any other enclosure. Each dinosaur in the river is worth 1 point at the end of the game.

Extra: T-Rex Bonus
If any enclosure (except the river) contains at least one T-Rex, that enclosure scores 1 extra point. The bonus is per enclosure, not per T-Rex. </p>

        <p>To start, each player receives a dinosaur park board, all using the same side; usually, it’s recommended to begin with the summer side. A bag with all the dinosaur pieces is prepared, and depending on the number of players, a few are removed at random to keep the game balanced. The youngest player begins by rolling the special die.

The game has two rounds, and each round consists of six turns. At the beginning of each round, every player draws six dinosaurs from the bag and keeps them hidden in their hand.

On each turn, the player with the die rolls it and announces the restriction that all the other players must follow when placing their dinosaur for that turn. Restrictions can include placing the dinosaur in a specific area of the board, in an empty enclosure, or avoiding putting it where there is already a T-Rex, for example. The player who rolled the die can ignore the restriction and place their dinosaur wherever they want.

After the die is rolled, each player secretly chooses one of their dinosaurs, and everyone reveals their choice at the same time. Then, each person places that dinosaur in their park, following the restriction shown on the die, except for the player who rolled it. If for any reason a player cannot (or doesn’t want to) follow the restriction, they can place the dinosaur in the river, which acts as a “discard” but still gives points.

Once all dinosaurs are placed, everyone passes their remaining dinosaurs to the player on their left and receives a new hand from the player on their right. This process repeats until no one has any dinosaurs left in hand, ending the round. The whole process repeats for the second round, and by the end, each park will have twelve dinosaurs.

At the end of the game, each player scores points based on how they filled each enclosure. The Forest of Sameness rewards you for grouping several of the same species together in a row, the Meadow of Differences gives points for collecting different species, the Prairie of Love rewards you for forming pairs of the same species, the Woody Trio only gives points if you place exactly three dinosaurs, King of the Jungle requires you to have at least as many of that type as any other player, and Solitary Island gives points if that dino is unique in your park. The river gives one point for each dinosaur placed there, and every enclosure (except the river) gains one extra point if it contains at least one T-Rex.

The winner is the player with the most points from all the enclosures, the river, and the T-Rex bonuses. If there is a tie, the player with the fewest T-Rex wins; if it’s still tied, they share the victory.
